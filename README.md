# Brainfuck programs

Sometimes I get the urge to write brainfuck. When I do, I commit the
results here.

Currently, it contains two quines. Technically neither is a quine, but
rather emits a quine once run.

`quinev0.bf` is an extremely simple, directly-encded quine. It's also
about 10kB due to the extremely simple encoding it uses.

`quine.bf` uses a more complex encoding, with a correspondibly more
complex decoder, but it manages to be around 1.5kB as a result.
